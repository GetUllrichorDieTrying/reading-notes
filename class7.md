## Class 7: Programming with JavaScript

### Control Flow

- Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line; however, conditionals and loops often change change the control flow.

### Functions

[FUNCTION REFERENCE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions)

- A function is a block of code that performs a task.
- A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it.
- Defined as `function`

### Example 1

    function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
    // code to be executed
    }

- When JavaScript reaches a `return` statement, the function will stop executing.
- Functions often compute a return value.

### Example 2

    let x = myFunction(4, 3);   // Function is called, return value will end up in x

    function myFunction(a, b) {
    return a * b;             // Function returns the product of a and b
    }

- Functions allow you to define code once and then use it over and over.

### - The `()` operator invokes the function

### Operators

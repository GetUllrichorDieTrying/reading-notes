### [What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-role-based-access-control-rbac-examples-benefits-and-more)

1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?

- Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization.

2. Share an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.

User | Read
Writer | Create, Read
Editor | Create, Read, Update
Admin | Create, Read, Update, Delete

3. What are the Benefits of RBAC?

- Reducing admin work, efficient, compliant.

### Compare the two following libraries:

1. [react-cookie library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookie)

- Allows you to utilize/manipulate cookies in react.

2. [react-cookies-component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookies)

- Allows you to utilize/manipulate cookies in react.

3. Which library would you prefer would you prefer? Why?

- First thing I looked at was the date. `react-cookie` was last published a year ago and mentions hooks right away. `react-cookies` was last published 3 years ago, and usage is explained with class components. I would assume the latter would not support FC/Hooks, or if it does, you would have to figure it out on your own.

**react-cookie** is the winner.

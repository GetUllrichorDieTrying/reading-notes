## Class 31: Context API

### [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

1. What can React Context provide your app?

- "Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level."

2. Why might we use Context?

- To provide data to many different nested levels.

3. Why should we use it sparingly?

- Component reuse becomes more difficult.

#### Takeaways

1. We make a "context" file that links two files rather than passing props through many components.
2. Context API is a powerful tool. React has many internal tools that can be utilized before reaching for a third party library. I better understand what it means when someone says "they went crazy with redux."

### [Intro to Node and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)


1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

Middleware is software that provides services to other software that might not be available by default.

2. Express the most popular __ __ ____.

Node Web Framework.

3. Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?

A framework that is unopinionated gives the user the ability to utilize the framework however they would like, which allows for more flexibility in the future.

4. What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?

Allows the developer to keep code organized into manageable parts.

## [What is NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm)

1. What version of npm are you running on your machine?

8.6.0

2. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project?

`npm i jshint`

## [What is TDD?](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType~(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'tdd))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1))

1. Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.

Testing our code allows us to make sure that we are not sending any broken code to a live production.

2. What are three expected benefits of testing

- Reduction in bugs.
- Final phases of project can be easier as a result of the upfront work.
- Can improve design quality of code.

3. Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

- Forgetting to run tests frequently.
- Writing too many tests at once.
- Partial adoption from the team.
- Poor maintenance of the test suite.


## [CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSv_m3KhUO8)

1. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

- Ensure everyone's changes integrate.
- Catch bugs.
- Reduce merge conflicts.

2. What is the difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

Continuous Delivery - Develop to release at any time.

Continuous Deployment - Deploy new features immediately.

3. Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background

GitHub houses the code that developers are using and tracks any changes that are made. GitHub also communicates when tests have passed.

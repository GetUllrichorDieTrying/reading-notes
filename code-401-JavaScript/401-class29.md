## Class 29: Advanced State with Reducers

### [useReducer Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer)

1. Name an alternative to the useState Hook.

- useReducer

2. Why might the useReducer Hook be preferable to the useState Hook?

- When you have complex state values.

3. What are two ways to set the initial state?

- Simple: Pass initial state into `useReducer` as second argument.
- Lazy: Pass `init` function as third argument to function `reducer`.

### [Ultimate Guide to useReducer](https://blog.logrocket.com/react-usereducer-hook-ultimate-guide/)

1. In terms of state, what does useReducer expect to receive as a parameter?

- "It accepts a reducer function as its first parameter and the initial state as the second."

2. What does useReducer return?

- "An array that holds the current state value and a dispatch function to which you can pass an action and later invoke it."

3. Explain dispatch to a non-technical recruiter.

- The `dispatch` function provides context of what we want our `useReducer` function to return. In this case, what action is a happening to the state. Passing `dispatch` to child components utilizes props.

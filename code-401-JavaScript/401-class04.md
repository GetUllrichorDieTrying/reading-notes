### [NoSQL vs SQL](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/)

1. What type of database is the best fit for the complex query intensive environment?

- SQL

2. What type of database is the best fit for hierarchical data storage?

- NoSQL

3. Describe the differences in scalability between a SQl and NoSQL database as though you were speaking to a non-technical friend.

- SQL scalability can be increased on a single server by improving CPU, RAM, SSD, etc. NoSQL you can add extra servers to obtain increased scalability.

## [SQL Modeling Techniques](https://www.essentialsql.com/get-ready-to-learn-sql-7-simplified-data-modeling/)

1. Among data tables, what is a one-to-many relationship and how do we “relate” them?

- We connect lines to show relationships between tables, and a `one-to-many` relationship is referring to tables that have multiple entry points.

2. Prior to designing your relational database, it might be useful to **_ a _** of the database tables and their relationships.

- Create diagrams.

3. Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.

- A primary key uniquely identifies each row. Table usually has one, but can have more.
- A foreign key is a column or set of columns that match a primary key in another table.

1. How do we treat keywords and parameters differently in SQL syntax?

- Keywords are in all caps, and parameters are written in lowercase.

2. Define normalization within the context of schemas and data.

- Schema tells us what columns will be on our table. We can also mock strictly types language.

3. Explain the difference between one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships to a non-technical recruiter.

- One to one: a table is connected to another by utilizing the other table's ID.
- One to many: ID is given to other tables to create many relationships.
- Many to many: Makes as many connections as possible.

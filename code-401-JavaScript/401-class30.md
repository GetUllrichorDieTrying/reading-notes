## Class 30: Hashtables

### Cheat Sheet

- Hash tables have an O(1) lookup.
- Hashing allows you to assign a position based on the key.
- Collisions are when multiple hashed keys end up in the same bucket (index) of the hash-table. Collisions can be dealt with in multiple ways. One example would be to utilize a linked list.
- GREAT FOR QUICK LOOKUPS!
- Learn about calculating load factors and choosing the optimal number of buckets, with the best hash function... if you really want to wow someone.

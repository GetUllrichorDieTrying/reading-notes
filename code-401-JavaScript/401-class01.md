### Node Ecosystem

1. How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

Node is a tool that allows us to run JavaScript outside of the browser. It is built off of the engine that run's the Google Chrome browser.

2. What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

Usually JS is run in the browser, so a runtime is just an instance that can run JS that might not be in the browser.

3. What is Node used for?

Running node allows us to use JS in the server. This means that our frontend and backend can speak the same language and it is easy to switch between the two. Node can run a variety of packages, and the ecosystem is extensive, so there are libraries for tons many different areas of development.

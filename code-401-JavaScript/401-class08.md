## Class 8: Access Control (ACL)

### [5 Steps to RBAC](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3060780/5-steps-to-simple-role-based-access-control.html)

1. What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?

- RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. Different users within an organization will have different privileges based upon their need and role.

2. Describe a Role/Permission hierarchy that you might implement using RBAC.

- Administrator
  - Moderator
    - User

3. What approach might you take to implement RBAC?

- The reading provides a great guide:
  1. Inventory your systems
  2. Analyze your workforce and create roles
  3. Assign people to roles
  4. Never make one-off changes
  5. Audit

### [wiki - RBAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)

1. If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?

- "This is what you have access to."

2. Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.

- Role assignment
- Role authorization
- Permission authorization

3. Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.

- RBAC is just a hierarchy of who can do what. An executive at a company would have permission to access pretty much all data in a company, while the someone at the front desk might only have a web browser and calendar available to them.

### [RBAC Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4NP8Eon3cA)

1. What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.

- User -> Role -> Rights
- _The person_ -> _assigned a role_ -> _this is what this role gives you access to, which leads back to the person_

2. Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a user successfully does what?

- When a user is successfully **authenticated**.

3. Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.

- Keeping information on a need-to-know basis is generally encouraged. In some businesses, it is the legal requirement. For example, medical offices that must comply with HIPPA.

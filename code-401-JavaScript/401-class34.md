## Class 34: API Integration

### [Review API Server Build](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/apps-and-libraries/api-server/)

1. Explain the different between a query string parameter and a path parameter.

- Path is location of specific resource, and query is the sort/filter.

2. What would our API URL with a path id parameter be given the following information:

- Domain: http://our-site.com
- v3
- model name: stuff
- id: things

**http://our-site.com/v3/stuff/things**

3. We have created a dynamic API with an “interface”. Describe how that interface works to a non-technical friend.

- An interface prescribes what to expect/occur under the hood for part of an api call. Can be used for multiple calls.

### [Review Auth Server Build](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/apps-and-libraries/auth-server/)

1. Describe how you would use middleware to implement basic and bearer auth.

- Middleware is used have something happen in the process of making an API call. You can use middleware to authenticate and authorize.

2. Describe the handshake necessary to implement OAuth.

- Pass a bearer token within handshake to verify the user.

3. Describe how Role Based Access Control works to a non-technical friend.

- Role based access is like giving someone keys to do something specific. You decide who gets what keys that can open only the doos they need to open.

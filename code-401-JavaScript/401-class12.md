### [Web Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

1. What is a Web Socket?

- "WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection...The WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server with lower overhead than half-duplex alternatives such as HTTP polling, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server."

2. Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.

- "The handshake starts with an HTTP request/response, allowing servers to handle HTTP connections as well as WebSocket connections on the same port. Once the connection is established, communication switches to a bidirectional binary protocol which does not conform to the HTTP protocol... Once the connection is established, the client and server can send WebSocket data or text frames back and forth in full-duplex mode. The data is minimally framed, with a small header followed by payload.WebSocket transmissions are described as "messages", where a single message can optionally be split across several data frames. This can allow for sending of messages where initial data is available but the complete length of the message is unknown (it sends one data frame after another until the end is reached and committed with the FIN bit)."

3. Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a \_\_\_\_ from that client.

### [Socket.io Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket.io/)

1. What does the event handler `io.on()` do?

- "The io.on event handler handles connection, disconnection, etc., events in it, using the socket object."

2. Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected

- "If you refresh your browser, it will disconnect the socket connection and recreate. You can see the following on your console logs âˆ’

```
A user connected
A user disconnected
A user connected
```

"

3. What does socket.emit() do?

- "To allow this, Socket.IO provides us the ability to create custom events. You can create and fire custom events using the socket.emit function."

### [Socket.io vs Web Sockets](https://www.educba.com/websocket-vs-socket-io/)

1. What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).

- Websocket is the protocol and socket.io is the library that utilizes the websocket protocol. Websocket is to socket.io' as git is to github.

1. When would you use Socket.IO?

- When you want a way to manage you use of websockets.

2. When would you use WebSockets?

- When you want an app that uses real time communication.

### [TCP Handshake Explained](https://www.educba.com/websocket-vs-socket-io/)

- A computer asks if it can connect to a server, then the server acknowledges saying yes, then the the computer will say, we're connected now.

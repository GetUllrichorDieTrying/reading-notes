## Class 32: Context API - Behaviors

### [Hooks and Context Example](https://medium.com/swlh/snackbars-in-react-an-exercise-in-hooks-and-context-299b43fd2a2b)

1. With regard to the React Context API, what does a “provider” do?

- Displays state and exposes an API to manage state globally.

2. With regard to the React Context API, how would we implement a “consumer” role?

- Grabs the information from the provider.

3. Specifically with Context, how are we “wrapping” components to achieve our goals?

- Utilize `useContext` on the appropriate provider.

I found the conclusion from [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/reacts-new-context-api-how-to-toggle-between-local-and-global-state-c6ace81443d0) particularly helpful: "However, not all premature optimizations are the root of all evil. You should find a good balance between simplicity and scalability. That is, you should pursue simple implementations, specially if you're building small applications. But, if you're planning to grow, you should look for simple implementations that are also easy to scale."

I always like to think of scalability when it comes to design, but I realize that over-engineering a product that is just trying to reach MVP could backfire. The more I learn, the better I will learn where that line is.

Still not sure why I would change a product that is using Redux to the context API. I get the point of not using a third party library, but if it is already working with similar performance, why change it? I know there are reasons out there. It sounds like Redux can be utilized with other libraries/frameworks as well. This interoperability sounds like it could make it a winnder.

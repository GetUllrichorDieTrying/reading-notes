## Engineering Readings

- "Deep work means absolutely not tolerating distractions and producing monumental quality and quantity in a very short time. This is how you can complete far more with focused efforts than unfocused efforts with far more time." -Cal Newport
- Problem solving for programmers is made manageable when the problem is broken in to small pieces, solved, and then connected.
- Interesting ideas regarding gamification of life and sticking to a plan to achieve the larger goal. I have done this to some regard my whole life.

### What I Bring

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

- This is not going to be what you are looking for, but maybe it is. I believe EVERY PERSON has something that they could contribute to a group that no one else can. We are a product of our experiences, and many people may have very similar experiences, but that does not mean that those experiences affect everyone in the same way. Every person is moulded by their surroundings, and all people can act differently according to the internal that suggests how we act to external stimulus.

- That being said, it is often hard to pinpoint what that ONE thing is. I believe my ONE thing is actually a culmination of many things. My experience in the military, my educational background, and my experiences as a child have greatly shaped who I am today. I don't quit.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- Take a break.
- Break the problem down into smaller steps.
- If completely lost in the sauce, don't be afraid to scrap my code and start over with a fresh mind.

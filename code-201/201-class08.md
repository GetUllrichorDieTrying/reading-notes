#### Layout

Flexbox - "Flexbox is a layout mechanism for one-dimensional layouts. Layout across a single axis, either horizontally or vertically. By default, flexbox will align the element's children next to each other, in the inline direction, and stretch them in the block direction, so they're all the same height."

Grid - "Grid is similar in a lot of ways to flexbox, but it is designed to control multi-axis layouts instead of single-axis layouts (vertical or horizontal space)."

Use the above. Theyt will make layouts much easier.

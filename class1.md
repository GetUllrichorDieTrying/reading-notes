### Markdown Notes

I am familiar with Markdown because I love using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to take notes for work and school. I'd definitely recommend checking it out! Sometimes I forget basic syntax, but I know many of the basics. The links below will serve as the perfect reference in the future.

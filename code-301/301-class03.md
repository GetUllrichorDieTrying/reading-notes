### Lists & Keys

What does .map() return?

- A new array of the same length with results of calling a function on every element in the calling array.

If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how
do I do that in React?

- Use curly braces in JSX to build and display collections of arrays.

Each list item needs a unique \_\_\_\_.

- Key.

What is the purpose of a key?

- Help identify if items have changed, are added, or are removed.

### The Spread Operator

What is the spread operator?

- `...` Spreads array into separate arguments.

List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

- Combining Objects
- Adding state in React
- Adding an item to a list
- Concatenating arrays.

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

```js
const myArray = [`🤪`, `🐻`, `🎌`];
const yourArray = [`🙂`, `🤗`, `🤩`];
const ourArray = [...myArray, ...yourArray];
console.log(...ourArray); // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩
```

Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

```js
const fewFruit = ['🍏', '🍊', '🍌'];
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit];
console.log(fewMoreFruit); //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]
```

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

```js
const objectOne = { hello: '🤪' };
const objectTwo = { world: '🐻' };
const objectThree = { ...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: '😂' };
console.log(objectThree); // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {
  ...objectOne,
  ...objectTwo,
  laugh: () => {
    console.log('😂'.repeat(5));
  },
};
objectFour.laugh(); // 😂😂😂😂😂
```

### How to pass functions between components

In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

- Create arrow function within constructor on app.js.

In your own words, what does the increment function do?

- There are multiple increment functions created. One sets state when clicked and increments the count. The other is checking if state has changed.

How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

- Pass the function into your object that is your child component.

How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?

- You call the method from the parent and pass the value into the parent method.

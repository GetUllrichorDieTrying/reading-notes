### React Lifecycle

Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

Render

What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

Constructor

Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates

componentDidMount, constructor, render, react updates, componentWillUnmount

What does componentDidMount do?

Invoked right after component is mounted. If you need to load a network request or initialize the DOM, it goes here.

### React State vs Props

What types of things can you pass in the props?

- You can pass arguments to initialize.

What is the big difference between props and state?

- State is handled inside the component and can be updated inside the component while props is handled outside.

When do we re-render our application?

- When the user has done something.

What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

- State would be used in forms to update for the user as they type.

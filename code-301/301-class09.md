### Functional Programming Concepts

What is functional programming?

- Functional programming basically focuses on using code to evaluate functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

- A pure function "returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)," and "It does not cause any observable side effects."

- A pure function will have all global objects passed as a parameter to the function.

What are the benefits of a pure function?

- Easy to test code,

What is immutability?

- Unable to be changed.

What is Referential transparency?

- if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

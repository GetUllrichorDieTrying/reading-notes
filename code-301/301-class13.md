### SPEED CRUD

- Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

CRUD describes the principle actions that you would conduct with a database.

REST describes how those actions actually take place between client and server. You need to use the proper REST verb to complete the desired CRUD action.

- If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?

1. Create your files and install dependencies.
2. Create your routes.
3. Create your schema.
4. Send information from proper file.
5. Receive information on proper file.

### SQL vs NoSQL

Five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL - SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); SQL databases are table based databases; SQL databases have predefined schema; SQL databases are vertically scalable; SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful.
NoSQL - NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database; NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores; NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data; NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable; NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.

What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

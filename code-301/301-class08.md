### API Design Best Practices

What does REST stand for?

- Representational State Transfer (REST).

REST APIs are designed around a \_\_\_\_.

- Hypermedia

What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.

- a URI.

What are the most common HTTP verbs?

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE

What should the URIs be based on?

- In general, it helps to use plural nouns for URIs that reference collections. It's a good practice to organize URIs for collections and items into a hierarchy.

Give an example of a good URI.

- `https://adventure-works.com/orders/customers/5/orders`

What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?

- A chatty API is a bad thing because a chatty API can expose a large number of small resources.

What status code does a successful GET request return?

- HTTP status code 200 (OK)

What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?

- If the client puts invalid data into the request, the server should return HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request)

What status code does a successful POST request return?

- HTTP status code 201 (OK)

What status code does a successful DELETE request return?

- If the delete operation is successful, the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204 (No Content)

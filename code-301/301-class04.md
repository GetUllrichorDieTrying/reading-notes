### React - Forms

What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

- With a controlled component, the input’s value is always driven by the React state.

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

- Since the value attribute is set on our form element, the displayed value will always be this.state.value, making the React state the source of truth. Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

```js
 <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
```

### Ternary Explained

Why would we use a ternary operator?

- Nested ternary operators can test multiple conditions.

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

```js
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}
```

Rewritten:

```js
x===y ? true : false; 
```
